# burger
A fun little app that allows users to create a wishlist of burgers they would like to devour, and keep track of those from their wishlist that they have devoured. This app is built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, HTML, and CSS.  The app allows a user to interact with a website to:

- add a burger they wish to devour; the app adds the burger to a devour wish list.
- indicate when a burger on the wish list has been devoured (and the burger moves to a devoured list).
- delete burgers from either the wish list or devoured list.
